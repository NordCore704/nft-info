What Does It Do?: Well This project is an NFT search app, it serves up real-time information of NFTs and their transaction data (transfer history, blockchain, holders, price, etc), users can filter search results based upon certain query parameters as provided by the API.

Technologies Used: This is a Nextjs project, the Frontend is entirely Nextjs(React Fullstack Framework), UI Animations on this projects were created using GSAP and Framer Motion, Axios was also integrated for API calls and consumption, Redux is installed as a dependency but was never used, solely because the state management cases in this project are small cases and React's Context can handle them nicelyüòó
